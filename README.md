# GPSD – Gravity Pit Sand Desalinator

**Open-source, zero-energy water filtration system**  
Created by Jean-Francis Kuoch – Independent Researcher  

GPSD (Gravity Pit Sand Desalinator) is a low-cost, scalable water purification concept using ultrafine sand and gravity-based trench systems.  
Designed for drought-prone regions and off-grid use cases, it is entirely mechanical, field-deployable, and free of proprietary constraints.

## 🔍 Overview

- **No electricity**
- **No pressurization**
- **No patents**
- Just sand, slope, and purpose.

GPSD enables pre-filtration of seawater or contaminated sources before final purification by solar or membrane means.
