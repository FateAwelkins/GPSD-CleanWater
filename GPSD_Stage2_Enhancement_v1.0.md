## üîÅ Purpose

This document outlines recommended secondary filtration enhancements to the GPSD system for improved water clarity, chemical polishing, and ethical material sourcing.

---

## üí° Passive Enhancement Philosophy

GPSD Stage 2 filters must remain:
- **Fully passive**
- **Low-cost**
- **Field-maintainable**
- **Ethically sourced**

No forced regeneration, no proprietary cartridges, no ecological cost shifting.

## üß± Recommended Enhancement Media

| Media Type       | Purpose                        | Notes |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| **Biochar**       | Removes VOCs, odors, bacteria | Use only waste-based (wood shop, crop husk, NOT deforestation)  
| **Zeolite**       | Ammonia, nitrates, metals     | Effective but hard to regenerate in coastal setups  
| **Sand**          | Polishing + support bed       | Cheapest, durable, reusable  
| **GAC (activated carbon)** | High-performance polishing | High cost, import-dependent

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Recommended Ratio (Sand + Biochar Blend)

| Configuration           | Suggested Ratio | Yield Benefit   | Notes |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Low-char blend**       | 90% sand / 10% biochar | ~10‚Äì15% polishing improvement | Cheap, stable  
| **Balanced mix**         | 70% sand / 30% biochar | ~20‚Äì30% polishing + odor control | Best value-performance tradeoff  
| **High-char stack layer**| Top 20‚Äì30cm pure biochar over sand | 30‚Äì40% gain for taste/smell | Maintenance needed every 6‚Äì12 months

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Performance Notes

- A biochar layer improves **VOC adsorption, color clarity, microbial polishing**
- Does **not affect salinity**, but improves perceived water quality
- Charcoal slows bacterial regrowth in storage tanks
- Avoid dense compaction ‚Äî biochar needs **loose structure** to avoid flow blockages

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Failure Case: Charcoal Collapse

Improperly aged or poor-quality charcoal can:
- Collapse into fine particles
- Clog the sand layer
- Turn into mud if too moist

**Solution:**  
Use **screened, granular biochar** (5‚Äì20 mm), preferably from kiln-processed dry woodshop waste. Avoid forest fire residue or powder fines.

---

## ‚úÖ Field Strategy Summary

- Use **sand as structural filter + support**
- Layer **biochar as polishing cap**
- Only use zeolite if:
  - Ammonia is high
  - You can dispose/replace yearly
  - You are not relying on it for salt-heavy water

**All media should be renewable, non-toxic, and regionally sourced where possible.**

## üîö Conclusion

GPSD Stage 2 filtration adds clarity and chemical polishing without sacrificing affordability or ethics. A simple 70:30 sand-biochar blend delivers a major water quality upgrade ‚Äî with no need for regeneration or machinery.

Clean trench. Clear water. Honest footprint.
