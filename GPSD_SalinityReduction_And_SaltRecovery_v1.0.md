# GPSD ‚Äì Results, Salinity Reduction, and Salt Recovery Notes

## üìä 1. Target Filtration Outcome

GPSD is designed as a **pre-treatment step** in water purification workflows. It is not a standalone potability system, but it significantly reduces particulate content and moderates salinity.

## üíß 2. Salinity Reduction Expectations

| Water Source Type        | Typical Input Salinity | Expected Output Range | Notes |
|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Coastal Seawater         | 30‚Äì35 ppt              | 18‚Äì25 ppt              | Sand retains some salts through surface crystallization and diffusion blockage |
| Brackish Groundwater     | 5‚Äì15 ppt               | 2‚Äì8 ppt                | Especially effective with slow trickle rate and fine layering |
| Floodwater / Contaminated Freshwater | Variable (0.5‚Äì10 ppt) | 0.2‚Äì3 ppt | Dependent on suspended solids and organic load |

> *Note: Values depend on sand type, grain size, flow rate, and pit structure.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Key Reduction Mechanisms

- **Capillary drag and pore retention:** traps salt-rich particles in fine grains
- **Surface crystallization:** visible salt crust formation at the top layers
- **Diffusion lag through packed media:** slows ion movement under low pressure

## üßÇ 4. Salt Recovery Process (Optional)

Users may opt to **harvest surface salt** for controlled reuse or disposal.

### A. Methods
1. **Top-layer skimming:** Remove the top 3‚Äì5 cm dry sand layer weekly (visible salt will be embedded).
2. **Evaporative crystallization basin (optional):** Divert partial flow to a shallow tank post-filtration for passive salt drying.
3. **Solar drying trays:** Spread high-salinity runoff on black tarp under sunlight to speed up crystallization.

### B. Recovery Estimate

| System Scale         | Weekly Salt Yield Estimate |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| 2m trench (daily use) | 0.5‚Äì1.2 kg salt             |
| 5m extended trench   | 2.5‚Äì4 kg salt               |
| 20m deep array       | 10+ kg salt (depending on feed) |

> *Yield is affected by brine strength and replacement cycle frequency.*

## üîÅ 5. Reuse Potential

- Non-potable cleaning or livestock-grade reuse
- Brine concentration for alternative saltworks
- Disposal into controlled waste pits or reentry zones
- Community-level salt trade or barter (experimental use only)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 6. Final Notes

- Always pair GPSD with a **final purification method** (RO, UV, boiling, etc.)
- Do not use recovered salt for food unless verified through laboratory-grade decontamination
- Sand contaminated with biologicals or pollutants must be fully replaced, not recycled
