# GPSD Whitepaper

## Abstract
GPSD is an open-source water filtration system using terrain geometry and ultrafine sand. It provides a low-cost, low-energy alternative for pre-treatment of saline or contaminated water sources.

## 1. Problem Statement
Global water scarcity and salinity pose increasing threats. Conventional RO systems require energy and maintenance. GPSD proposes a mechanical alternative that can function in low-resource settings.

## 2. Design Summary
- Constructed with deep sand trenches
- Uses gravity to drive flow
- Layered ultrafine sand for sediment and particulate capture
- Salt buildup handled through scheduled sand removal
