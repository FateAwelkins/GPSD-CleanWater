## 📐 1. Design Overview

The GPSD Funnel-Column Filter Model (FTV-SFC) is a hybrid passive filtration system designed for semi-industrial or urban water pre-treatment. It utilizes a wide conical reservoir to collect water and drive it through a compact, vertically packed ultrafine sand column for high-pressure filtration.

## 🧱 2. Structural Layout

| Component            | Spec Suggestion         |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Funnel Diameter       | 3–5 meters              |
| Column Diameter       | 1 meter (inner core)    |
| Sand Column Height    | 10 meters               |
| Drain Layer (Bottom)  | 30–50 cm gravel         |
| Outlet                | Central tube with pump or siphon  

**Total vertical height:** 11–12 meters  
**Material suggestion:** HDPE tank cone top + reinforced PVC or earth-packed column with concrete ring support

## 💧 3. Expected Filtration Performance

| Parameter             | Estimate                |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Filtration Rate**     | 0.8 – 1.5 liters/min/m²  
| **Yield/day (1m² base)**| ~1,200 – 2,000 liters/day  
| **Salinity Reduction** | Up to 30% (pre-treatment), depends on brine intensity  
| **Suspended Solids**   | >95% removal  
| **Colloid / Particulate** | >90% reduction  

*Note: Efficiency improves with microbial biofilm maturity in lower column layers*

## 🧽 4. Maintenance Requirements

| Task                       | Frequency           |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Top funnel sediment skim   | Weekly              |
| Check for channeling       | Monthly             |
| Remove top 10cm sand       | Quarterly or as flow drops  
| Full sand replacement      | Every 18–36 months  |

Maintenance can be done manually or with vacuum-extraction of sand tops. Column should be flushed during full replacement.

## ⛏️ 5. Construction Estimates (Standard Unit)

| Item                   | Cost Range (€)         |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| HDPE or Steel Funnel   | €250–€600              |
| Sand (ultrafine, 10m³) | €300–€600              |
| PVC Column (1m x 10m)  | €200–€400              |
| Gravel + Bedding       | €50–€100               |
| Basic Pump (manual/electric) | €100–€200         |
| Labor & Excavation     | €400–€800 (varies)     |
| **Total**              | **~€1,300 – €2,700**    |

Costs vary by region, labor, and sourcing of sand material.

## 🛠️ 6. Construction Time Estimate

| Phase                        | Time Estimate      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| Funnel Forming & Setup       | 1 day              |
| Column Excavation/Assembly   | 2–3 days           |
| Sand & Layering              | 1–2 days           |
| Plumbing & Pump Setup        | 1 day              |
| Test & Calibration           | 0.5 day            |
| **Total Duration**           | **~5–7 days**       |

Can be shortened with mechanical help or prefab materials.
