# Gravity Pit Sand Desalinator (GPSD) – Full System Document

## 📘 Abstract

The Gravity Pit Sand Desalinator (GPSD) is a zero-electricity, low-cost water pre-filtration system designed to operate in coastal or arid environments. It uses natural slope, ultrafine sand, and layered structure design to remove salts and impurities from water sources before final purification. This document serves as a full survival-engineering guide for deployment, maintenance, and local adaptation.

## 🧪 1. System Overview

**Principle:** Passive gravity-fed filtration through ultrafine sand layers  
**Target Use:** Coastal villages, refugee camps, drought zones, off-grid setups  
**Core Materials:** Local sand, digging tools, gravel or mesh layer for drainage, optional flow diverters

---

## 📐 2. System Design & Flow

- **Trench Depth:** 1.5–2 meters recommended
- **Sand Layers:** 
  - Top: Fine dry sand (5–10 cm)
  - Middle: Ultrafine filter-grade sand (30–60 cm)
  - Bottom: Coarse sand or fine gravel (15 cm)
- **Drainage:** Side slope or central collection pipe (gravity exit)
- **Flow Direction:** Entry at top grade, gravity pulls water through sand stack
- **Crystallization Layer:** Monitor salt collection in top 15 cm

## 🏗️ 3. Construction Guidelines

### A. Tools
- Shovel or trenching tool
- Waterproof sheet (optional liner)
- Local containers or tanks
- Cloth mesh (to prevent sand migration)

### B. Steps
1. **Select location**: Slightly sloped terrain or dug channel.
2. **Excavate trench**: 1.5–2 m deep, width ~50–80 cm
3. **Layer installation** (bottom to top):
   - Coarse gravel
   - Ultrafine sand
   - Dry sand
4. **Install catchment or outlet**
5. **Cover to reduce evaporation (wood, tarps)**

## 🌍 4. Scenario-Based Deployment

| Scenario                     | Notes                                              |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Coastal Desert Village       | Long trench, continuous use, group filtration      |
| Emergency Post-Flood Camp    | Small modular units, rapid construction            |
| Schoolyard or Educational Use| Transparent casing for demonstration               |
| Remote Farm Ridge            | Sloped trench using hillside to drive flow         |

## 🔁 5. Maintenance & Recovery

- **Weekly**: Check flow rate, inspect surface clogging
- **Monthly**: Remove top 5 cm layer if salt crystallization visible
- **Bi-Annually**: Replace ultrafine sand core
- **Avoid**: Contamination by waste water or soaps

---

## ⚠️ 6. Known Issues & Limitations

- Does not produce potable water directly (requires final treatment)
- May clog in clay soils or algae-heavy sources
- Evaporation losses if uncovered
- Salt removal is passive, not active (harvest surface crust)
