## 💧 Water Output Classifications (Post-GPSD Stage 2)

| Input Source     | Output Profile           | Suggested Use Cases              |
|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Seawater         | Clearer, still salty      | Pre-treatment for RO or solar stills  
| Brackish runoff  | Reduced solids, light salt | Drip irrigation, salt-tolerant crops  
| Floodwater       | Odor-free, partially sterilized | Livestock cleaning, greywater reuse  
| Agricultural runoff | Reduced turbidity & pathogens | Return to fields, washwater for tools

## 🔁 "Tamed Water" Category

This refers to **filtered, biologically safer water** not yet potable, but suitable for:
- Controlled irrigation
- Soil moisture recharge
- Evaporation-to-recovery staging
- Final RO entry stage (less wear on membranes)

---

## 🧂 Brine Residue Management

Post-GPSD brine is:
- Lower in suspended solids
- Slower to clog in salt pans
- Suitable for:
  - Halophyte irrigation
  - Salt recovery beds
  - Greywater re-processing loop

## 📊 3-Year Cost-Gain Projection (1 Standard Unit)

| Item                        | Cost Estimate (€) | Notes |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Initial Setup (GPSD Core + Stage 2) | €1,800–€2,500     | Includes funnel column + biochar blend  
| Maintenance (sand, top skims)       | €150–€300/year     | Quarterly top layer change, yearly flush  
| Biochar/Refill or GAC (if used)     | €100–€200/year     | Based on usage, locally sourced  
| Minor repairs/screen/overflow       | €50/year           | Typical upkeep

**3-Year Total Cost:** ~€2,400 – €3,800 (max)

## 💧 3-Year Water Output (Estimated, 1m² Unit)

| Scenario         | Daily Output | 3-Year Output | Value Equivalent* |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Gravity passive (avg.) | ~1,500 liters | ~1.64 million L | €3,000–€5,000 in bottled water equivalency  
| Pressure-enhanced | ~2,500 liters | ~2.73 million L | €5,000–€8,000 (in greywater/irrigation value)

\*Assumes €1.50–€3.00 per 1,000L for agricultural or municipal reuse class water.

## ✅ Net Outcome

| Metric                  | Value                   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| ROI (non-potable use)   | ~2x–3x water value vs cost  
| Maintenance load        | Low (quarterly attention)  
| Expandability           | Modular, scalable by unit  
| Long-term viability     | High — materials locally available  
| Environmental impact    | Low waste, no fuel dependency

## 🔚 Summary

The GPSD system offers a **clean, ethical, low-cost path to high-volume tamed water production**, suitable for semi-industrial use, rural communities, and agricultural resilience. Over 3 years, even one system pays for itself in water returned to land or infrastructure bypassed.
