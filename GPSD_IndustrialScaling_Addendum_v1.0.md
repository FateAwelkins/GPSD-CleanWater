## 🔍 1. Purpose

This addendum outlines scaling methodologies for the Gravity Pit Sand Desalinator (GPSD) to function as a **regional intake pre-treatment** system in desertic zones or salt-heavy environments, with integrated **salt extraction and triage**.

---

## 🏜️ 2. Desert Deployment Considerations

- **Solar intensity:** enhances passive evaporation in open salt basins
- **Soil composition:** assess for erosion and silt intrusion
- **Wind shear:** requires covered channels or aerodynamic trench walls
- **Water transport:** gravity-fed channels from ocean or borehole intake preferred

## 🧱 3. Scalable System Layout

| Component                | Description                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Intake Trench** | 10–20m long, deep-set (2–4m), wide-mouth to accept brine |
| **Sand Channel Filter**   | Multi-layer filtration, high surface area                |
| **Flow Split Junction**   | Diverts liquid between usable pre-treated water and salt-rich runoff |
| **Solar Drying Basin**    | Crystallization field, open-air, 10x10m+ panels or trays |
| **Wind-Powered Agitation**| Windmill or vent-powered flow regulator for constant feed |

## 🧂 4. Salt Recovery Triage Strategy

> *“Separate usable water. Extract valuable salt. Minimize waste.”*

### Phase 1: Brine Segregation
- **Design inlet tapering** to slow laminar flow and allow sediment sink
- **Install basin skimmers** to collect surface crust mechanically

### Phase 2: Controlled Evaporation
- **Flow high-salt output into lined beds**
- **Layered sun trays** (stacked angle planes) for vapor lift

### Phase 3: Salt Harvest
- Weekly manual removal or raking
- Potential mechanical harvester in multi-lane setups
- Salt may be reused for:
  - Trade/barter (non-food)
  - Livestock mineral blocks
  - Saltcrete production

## 🔁 5. Industrial Scaling Tactics

| Element                  | Scalable Design |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **Modular Trenches**     | Interconnected 5x5m grid with overflow ports |
| **Filtration Units**     | Replaceable sand containers or cartridges |
| **Salt Vaults**          | Central dry domes or tarp-covered heap zones |
| **Staffing**             | 2–4 operators per hectare cluster |

> Suggested throughput: 15,000–20,000 liters/day across 20–30 trench segments

---

## ⚠️ 6. Limitations & Mitigation

- Not suitable for potable water without final RO/membrane filter
- Salt purity varies; requires separation from microdebris
- Heat loss at night—covering or thermal battery may help
- Long-term sand degradation → plan refresh cycles annually

---

## 🛠️ 7. Conclusion

GPSD can be scaled into a **modular, passive desalination system** with **integrated salt recovery** suited for industrial outposts, desert towns, or field research stations. Future extensions may include robotic skimming, solar distillation overlay, or AI flow sensors.
