## ⚙️ Pumping Integration for GPSD Systems

While GPSD is designed to function passively via gravity, **minimal pumping is required** for:
- Drawing filtered water from the base reservoir
- Optionally distributing water to holding tanks or irrigation lines

## 🔌 Pumping Requirements Overview

| Task                      | Requirement            | Notes |
|---------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Water extraction (10m lift) | Small submersible or surface pump (250–400W) | Intermittent use only  
| Daily usage duration      | ~30–60 minutes         | Based on 2,000L/day  
| Energy source             | Solar, grid, or generator | Solar highly recommended

## 🔋 Energy Consumption Estimate

| Parameter           | Value                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Avg pump power      | 300W                     |
| Avg runtime/day     | 1 hour                   |
| Daily consumption   | 300 Wh (0.3 kWh)         |
| Annual consumption  | ~110 kWh                 |
| 3-Year consumption  | ~330 kWh                 |

## 💰 Pumping Cost (3-Year)

| Region Type         | Energy Cost/kWh | 3-Year Pump Cost |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Solar (standalone)  | €0 after install  | ~€150–€300 (hardware only)  
| Grid – Europe avg   | €0.25             | ~€82.50  
| Diesel gen (1 kWh = 0.4L diesel) | ~€0.60+ | ~€198  

---

## 🧠 Notes

- Small solar water pumps (12V–24V) are highly efficient and well-suited to GPSD deployment
- Manual pumping is possible if electric is unavailable, but limits throughput
- Automated float activation is ideal for drawing only clean, settled water

## 📦 Adjusted 3-Year Total (Including Pumping)

| Total System Element      | Cost (Range €)     |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| GPSD + Stage 2 Build      | €1,800–€2,500       |
| Maintenance (3 years)     | €450–€800           |
| Pump + energy (solar/grid)| €80–€300            |
| **Total**                 | **€2,330–€3,600**   |

Water output remains: **1.6M–2.7M liters**

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

Factoring pump energy and cost into GPSD deployment increases the total budget by ~€80–€300 over 3 years — a marginal increase for maintaining consistent daily access. Solar-driven pumps ensure autonomy, while grid use remains low-cost for intermittent operation.
